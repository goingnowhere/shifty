# Shift management system

## Overview
Nowhere needs one system for managing the various event time roles, which participants sign-up for, both before the event, and during the event.

We need to have a simple system that:
  - works over the web
  - works offline
  - can do print-outs of schedule for on-site display
  - can do "my shifts" function for people, ideally offline as well as mobile based (and cached on mobiles so internet is not required)
  - has the concept that some shifts need manager's approval

## Users
 1. Participants after information on shifts
 1. Participants signing up for a shift
 1.	Shift managers
 1. Leads for the event (e.g. sound lead)
 1. (Event-time) volunteer co-ordinators
 1. Event managers (over all)
 1. Supreme Overlord / Master Scheduler
 1. Geeks wanting to build functionality based on solution
 
##Â Scenarios
1. As a user, I want to be able to see what shifts are available, what skills I need in advance, and the ability to ask questions to the responsible person (without needing to know who that is)

1. As a user, I want a simple sign-up experience, where I only enter my details once, but don't care about the internal silos

1. As a user, I want to be able to see what shifts are available, what skills I need in advance, and the ability to sign up for a shift

1. As a user, I will need to provide some information about me, including past experience in the form of yes/no answers, that will form the basis of qualification criteria
  
1. As a lead, I want to be able to define my shifts (when, length, location)
   
1. As a lead, I want to be able to define my requirements for the people who'll be on shifts (previous experience, aptitude, gender, based on responses to yes/no questions)

1. As a lead, I want to say how many of what role I want on each shift (_"as a Malfare lead, I want to specify Monday before event needs 2 Nomads for each shift; every event day requires 4 nomads / shift; party time requires 10 nomads"_)

1. As a lead, I want to be able to define some roles as needing my approval/confirmation

1. As a lead, I want to export all shifts that need filling, so I can reach-out to a wider community to ask them to step-up to take on a role.
  
1. As supreme overlord, I want to give other people supervisory/management permissions, ideally in a granular fashion (i.e. sound lead can manage sound schedules only)

1. As a user I want to receive reminders of when my shifts are, via email, an app on my phone, and have the ability to easily print this
   
1. As a manager, I want to re-assign people to schedules to balance things out, and let people who are reassigned know pretty much straight away

1. As a cook, I want to see how many people are on-shift at any one time, and their dietary needs, so I can have a display telling me how many meals and of what type to cook

1. As a geek, I want a fully documented API that lets me do things programatically, with the app, so I can build custom functionality that's not native to the apps/website approaches.

1. As a purchasing manager, I want a SaaS solution, that has good support around the clock, strong uptime, and the ability to export everything for offline working, and nice displaying.
